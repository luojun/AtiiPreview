Atii Preview
============

Atii is a mobile app -- currently Android only -- for reading picture books with kids. This repository is for sharing preview builds of Atii versions before release.

“Atii” is an Inuktitut word meaning “Come on! Let’s go! Go ahead!”. Here, it means “Read with me!”, “Let’s read!”, or “You can read!” and conveys the excitement around shared reading.

Atii
----

The inspiration of Atii came from my work for [Dream Corps International][1] (see also [this interview][2]), where volunteers spend a lot of time reading with children in rural China. Atii allows a shared reading to be recorded during the reading. The children may then revisit such readings in the absence of the volunteers. Atii could also be used for training volunteers, by allowing them to practice reading picture books aloud on the device. It is also useful for other purposes as illustrated by the demo books included in the app.

Atii is a [Dragonfly Studios][3] project.

Version 0.7
-----------

This version requires **Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and up**. It has been tested on a Galaxy Nexus phone and a Nexu 7 tablet and it apperas to be fairly stable. The main work yet to be done for release incldues (1) color scheme fine tuning, (2) button image improvement, (3) the app icon, (4) compatibility with earlier Android versions (e.g. through using [ActionBarSherlock][4]), and (5) test on more devices and Android versions.

Demo Books
----------

Four books are included in this version to demonstrate aspects of the app. You are strongly encouraged to go through all of them to get a good sense of what the app does and what the experience of using it is like.

The size of the APK is close to 7MB, due to the inclusion of demo books as assets in the APK.

Installation
------------

You can just download [the Atii v0.7 APK][5] to your device and install it from there.
