Atii Preview
============

Atii is a mobile app -- currently Android only -- for reading picture books with kids. This repository is for sharing preview builds of Atii versions before release.

“Atii” is an Inuktitut word meaning “Come on! Let’s go! Go ahead!”. Here, it means “Read with me!”, “Let’s read!”, or “You can read!” and conveys the excitement around shared reading.

Atii
----

The inspiration of Atii came from my work for Dream Corps International (wwww.dreamcorps.org), where volunteers spend a lot of time reading with children in rural China. Atii allows a shared reading to be recorded during the reading. The child may then revisit these readings in the absence of the volunteers. Atii could also be used for training volunteers, by allowing them to practice reading picture books aloud on the device. It is also potentially useful for other purposes as illustrated by the demo books.

Demo Books
----------

Four books are included in this version to demonstrate aspects of the app. You are strongly encouraged to go through all of them to get a good sense of what the app does and what the experience of using it is like.

The size of the APK at close to 7MB is mainly due to the inclusion of the demo books as assets in the APK.

Version 0.7
-----------

This version requires Android 4.0 (Icen Cream Sandwich) and up. It has only been tested on a Galaxy Nexus phone and a Nexu 7 tablet and it apperas to be fairly stable. The main work yet to be done for release incldues (1) color scheme fine tuning, (2) button image improvement, (3) the app icon, (4) compatibility with earlier Android versions (e.g. through using ActionBarSherlock), and (5) test on more devices and Android versions.

Installation
------------

You can just download the APK to your device and install it from there.
